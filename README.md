## Description 

This is a simulator that was developed in Java 1.8. It has 5 default planes, the program allows the user to create additional planes within a defined set of parameters. As of right now, the program lacks try-catches when adding a new aircraft, be mindful of the data type the console is asking. This will be something that gets added in the future. 

##Tech Used

Java, file I/O, Interfaces

##Lessons Learned

Being able to integrate a file into an array list along with creating an an abstract class that implements interfaces was also a challenging lesson.
